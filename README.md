Programming Task
We've created a simple multiplayer card game where:
7 players are dealt 5 cards from two 52 card decks, and the winner is the one with the highest score.
The base score for each player is calculated by adding up all 5 card values for each player, where:
The number cards have their numerical value.
Face card values are J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13
A = 11 (not 1).
In the event of a tie, the scores are recalculated for only the tied players by calculating a "suit score" for
each player to see if the tie can be broken (it may not).
Each card is given a value based on its suit, with hearts = 1, spades = 2, clubs = 3 and diamonds
= 4, and the player's score is calculated as the suit value of the playerâ€™s highest card.
You are required to write a command line application using C# or JavaScript (Node application) that needs to
do the following:
Run on Windows.
Be invoked with the name of the input and output text files.
Read the data from the input file, find the winner(s) and write them to the output file.
Handle any problems with the input or input file contents.
How to Submit Code
Please just send us an email with this pdf and a single file named game.cs or game.js file attached.
Your application will be tested using an automated test runner, so your application must run to completion
without any user input beyond the initial command parameters.
JavaScript
It will be run from console as follows:
 node game.js --in abc.txt --out xyz.txt
C#
It will be compiled and the resultant exe will be run from console as follows:
 game.exe --in abc.txt --out xyz.txt
Command Parameters
The command parameters can be in any order.
The file names can vary.
It can be assumed that if they are not located in the same directory as the application, that the path will
be supplied as part of the file name.
 --in abc.txt --out xyz.txt
Input File Format
The input file will contain 7 rows, one for each player's hand of 5 cards.
Each row will contain the player's name followed by a colon then a comma separated list of the 5 cards.
Each card will consist of the face value and the suit (H = Hearts, S = Spades, C = Clubs and D =
Diamonds).
Example: KD = King of Diamonds, 4C = Four of Clubs.
Input is not case-sensitive.
Spaces can be ignored.
Do not make assumptions about the correctness of the input.
Output File Format
The output file should contain a single line, with one of the following 3 possibilities:
The name of the winner and their score separated by a colon. (Base Value only if there's a clear winner
OR Base + Suit Value if there was a broken tie)
Example:
Player1:35
A comma separated list of winners in the case of a tie that can't be broken and their score separated by
a colon. (Base + Suit Value)
Example:
Player1,Player2:38
"Exception:[reason]" if the input file or its contents had any issues (validate the input).
Example:
Exception:<Some nice reason why the input is wrong.>
